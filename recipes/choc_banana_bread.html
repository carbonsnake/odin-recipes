        <ul>
            <li>2 cups All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp Baking Powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp Baking Soda</li>

            <li>3 Ripe Bananas (mashed)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Milk</li>
            <li>3 tsp Ground Cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 cup White Sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Butter (softened)</li>
            <li>2 large Eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup Chocolate Chips</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan, preferably glass.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Stir bananas, milk, and cinnamon 
                in another bowl. Beat sugar and butter together in a third bowl with an electric mixer until 
                light and fluffy; add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir banana 
                mixture into butter mixture; mix in flour mixture until just blended. Fold in chocolate chips; 
                pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 
                70 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack 
                before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
